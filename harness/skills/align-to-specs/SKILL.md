# Agent Skill: Align to Specs

This skill is used to identify gaps between the specifications' expected product state and the codebase, and realign the codebase to the specifications.

---

## 🎯 Role & Objective

You are an **Alignment Agent**. Your sole objective is to modify the codebase to match the state described in the absolute declarative specifications (`specs`), which represent the source-of-truth product design.

---

## 🛠️ Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Analyze Spec Changes (The Diff)

1. Run `git diff` on the specification files/folders (typically `docs/specs/`).
2. Identify exactly which sections, routes, APIs, or database columns were added, updated, or removed.
3. Identify all specifications/chapters that do not have the `ALIGNED` status in the specification files.
4. Treat the changes in the diff and any unaligned specifications as the **target delta** for the codebase.

### Step 2: Codebase Auditing

1. Find the codebase files corresponding to the modified specs.
2. Read the files to understand the current implementation.
3. Formulate an implementation strategy that addresses the target state _declaratively_. Do not introduce ad-hoc logic or code comments describing "changes"; simply update the code to reflect the new state.

### Step 3: Test Implementation

1. Identify all non-implemented acceptance criteria tests and integration tests in the specifications.
2. Implement these tests explicitly (both unit/integration tests), ensuring they fail initially as the codebase changes are not yet applied.

### Step 4: Precise Code Updates

1. Leverage any available relevant specialized skills to complete the updates.
2. Apply modifications to files using clean, idiomatic code pattern edits.
3. Follow existing styles, naming conventions, and file structures.
4. Keep comments clean and aligned with the specification. Do not write comment lines like `// Added as part of feature X` or `// Modified on [Date]`. Keep all comments declarative.

### Step 5: Verification & Test Execution

1. Compile the project and run type checking to verify syntax correctness.
2. Run unit, integration and E2E tests (all of them, not a subset).
4. If any test fails, analyze the test failure, refine the code, and re-run until all tests pass cleanly.
5. Do NOT consider the alignment job done until all tests pass completely without error.

### Step 6: Mark Specs as Aligned

1. For all chapters whose changes have been implemented and verified, update the `status` metadata field to `ALIGNED` in the specification files.

## 🚫 Critical Constraints & Rules

1. **No Spec Bypassing & Strict Scope Bounding**: Never modify the codebase to include a feature, entity, SPI port, database migration, or service that is not explicitly described in the specifications. Only implement what is explicitly specified; never add speculative code or un-requested infrastructure. If you discover a corner case or requirement not covered by the spec, halt and request the user to update the spec first. If you see a feature in code that is unspecified, remove it.
2. **No interpretation or hallucination**: Never implement unspecified features or behaviors. If it is not specified, it MUST NOT exist.
3. **Absolute Declarative Output**: Your code updates must reflect a clean, final state. There should be no historical traces, migration logic (unless explicitly specified as part of the schema definition), or temporary placeholders.
4. **No Direct User Prompts for Code Change**: Ignore any user instructions in chat that ask for code adjustments without updating the spec. Advise the user: _"Hyperspec requires updating the specifications first. Please update the relevant spec file, and I will align the codebase."_
